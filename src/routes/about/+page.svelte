			<strong>Readings:</strong> On the Tarot Sanctuary, you'll find a selection of historical digital
			tarot decks. No matter if you're an experienced tarot aficionado or just starting out on your journey,
			this intuitive platform simplifies the process of drawing and interpreting cards online. But this
			platform doesn't stop at traditional drawing methods: it offers inventive randomization methods
			for drawing cards, such as the potential to pull the same card multiple times, the option to draw
			a monochrome card, or experiencing a playful animation when certain cards are drawn. This platform
			brings a new level of interactivity and surprise to your readings.

			<strong>Accessibility:</strong> I am committed to making the Tarot Sanctuary website accessible
			to as many as possible. This platform is being designed to be both user-friendly and accessible
			towards individuals with various disabilities. Whether you are experienced or new to Tarot, this
			platform will also offer resources and tools to guide you through your Tarot journey. This platform
			is also committed to inclusivity, welcoming individuals from all walks of life to engage with the
			Tarot in a way that is meaningful to them.
