	<h1>About this platform</h1>

	<p>
		Welcome to the Tarot Sanctuary, your revolutionary digital platform for creating, understanding,
		and utilizing the Tarot. Here you can play and have fun with both traditional tarot decks and
		new innovative decks but this is not just a platform for readings; it's also an experimental
		space for innovators from all walks of life, regardless of their experience with the Tarot. The
		other goal being developed is to provide a collaborative environment where you can design and
		create new Tarot Systems. I believe that the Tarot isn't a fixed system but an evolving language
		that can be expanded and redefined to reflect the complexity of our times. We are not merely
		interpreters of the Tarot's wisdom, but its creators as well. I believe in the power of
		collective intelligence, encouraging every participant on this website to contribute, exchange
		ideas, and enrich our collective understanding. Welcome to the Tarot Sanctuary, a safe space for
		your Tarot journey.

	<h2>My Story</h2>

	<p>
		The seeds of the Tarot Sanctuary were first planted in 2022, germinating from a fervent passion
		for the rich symbolism of the traditional Tarot combined with the belief in the need of creating
		fresh new metanarratives. I envisioned a unique platform and community where individuals could
		not only use, but also create novel Tarot systems tailored to the dynamics of the modern age,
		all while ensuring its accessibility to everyone, irrespective of their level of familiarity
		with the Tarot. This vision gave birth to the development of the Tarot Sanctuary - with the goal
		of being a space that transcends the traditional boundaries of Tarot wisdom and interpretation.
		My vision is to create an environement for new metanarratives, a breeding ground for innovative
		Tarot systems. A place where ancient wisdom is honored yet reframed or if needed transcended to
		resonate with contemporary consciousness. My vision is that every participant is both a student
		and a creator. In the future this platform will not only be used for readings and learning about
		the tarot, but a platform where creators can contribute their own interpretations, systems, and
		insights.
