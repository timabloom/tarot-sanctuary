	<h1>Welcome, dear one to the Tarot Sanctuary!</h1>
	<p>
		Before we embark on our Tarot journey together, I want to invite you to consider these three
		guiding maxims: Know thyself, Nothing in excess and Surety brings ruin. By keeping these
		principles in mind, we can approach the Tarot with love and respect, and open ourselves up to
		its deep wisdom and transformative potential. So let's take a deep breath, center ourselves, and
		embark on this beautiful journey of discovery and self-exploration together!
